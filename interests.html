<h2>âœ¨ANCIENTSâœ¨</h2>
<div class="centered">
    <img src="img/ancients.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" title="Or what if time, as we know it, is irrelevant?.">
</div>

<h3 class="centered">ANCIENT EGYPTIANS</h3>
<p class="centered">
    Ancient Egyptians are recognized as one of the oldest civilizations that has ever graced this Earth and honestly, they deserve it. They pioneer medicine, architecture, religion and even women's rights! Their history is so interesting, especially in regards to their mythology and the lives of ancient pharaohs (women pharaohs, too!).
</p>

<h3 class="centered">ANCIENT GREEKS</h3>
<p class="centered">
    We, the modern people, have a lot in common with the Ancient Greeks; we love to gossip. The Greeks are known for their well-detailed stories of their gods and goddesses and some scandals, shocking! Nevertheless, Ancient Greeks have contributed so much to our civilization to be what they are today; for instance, democracy (vote!).
</p>

<h3 class="centered">THE BYGONE ERAS</h3>
<p class="centered">
    The bygone eras, by which I mean the Renaissance, the Tudor and Elizabethan, as well as the ridiculous Victorians, I like to research about them and find interesting tidbits. Oh! Did you know, the cause of the lack of male heirs in the Tudor bloodline falls entirely on King Henry VIII? If he had known, he would not have the infamous six wives as history knows today!
</p>

<h3 class="centered">ANCIENT RETELLINGS</h3>
<p class="centered">
    It has always been an enjoyment for me to read ancient retellings, no matter in what country or genre of history they rely on. For example, the love between Achilles and his beloved, Patroclus has been the favorite subject of authors in the Western world to use, and Madeleine Miller never disappoints as she has written a novel on both of the couple, aptly titled 'Song of Achilles'.

<h2>ðŸ“–MANHWASðŸ“–</h2>
<div class="centered">
    <img src="img/manhwas.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" title="And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other, in another life, you still would've turned my head.">
</div>
<p class="centered">
    I read all kinds of genres of books, but comics or manhwas in Korean are my favorite. I usually focus on drama, mystery, and detective genres, yet I also love old-fashioned romance to make my heart giddy along the reading process.
</p>

<h2>âœ¨MUSICALS!!!âœ¨</h2>
<p class="centered">
    Due to being raised with Disney movies that are filled with enchanting and nostalgic musicals, my music taste has become diverse, including musicals.
</p>
<p class="centered">
    These four musicals below have a special place in my heart. They are not only entertaining and fun but also informative (in some parts!). They remind me of the little girl I used to be; carefree.

<h2>K-POP</h2>
<p class="centered">
    In the world of K-POP, I am a multifan, a fan that supports different kinds of boy or girl bands and have close associations with their fandoms too. I knew BTS from my older sister, a long-time supporter of them, while the other three K-POP groups are due to their songs that fit my mood just right.

<h2>~ANIMES~</h2>
<p class="centered">
    Honestly, I am not a fan of watching drama series unless I am very <b>seriously</b> intrigued. Animes, especially in another foreign language, have enabled me to be more open to knowing about another's significant culture as well as the uniqueness that lies underneath. Japanese animes significantly color my life, especially during my teenage years, ever since my sister introduced me to my first anime; Kaichou Wa Maid-sama or in its English title, Maid-sama!.

        </a>
        <p class="centered">
            This anime is a must-watch for those who love suspense and philosophical debate between two people who are actually the two sides of the same coin. It argues the theory of the usage of God when we, human beings, can be a destroyer of our own due to greed and wanting power?
        </p>

        </a>
        <p class="centered">
            Aptly titled, this anime tells you a story of a brother who has given his very best to make sure his sister becomes herself; not as a demon as she was bitten to, but the young girl who smiles at him every time he comes home. This story is so well-written, filled with interesting plots and stories that will not bore the audience along the way. Most importantly, it teaches that pain as well as suffering can be experienced by anyone, no matter a human being or even a demon, yet it does not give you the right to harm other people for the sake of vengeance or pure greed.

        <p class="centered">
            Hanako-Kun is a boy who is also a guardian spirit for the school and handles the rumors that can cause the existence of those spirits around. A girl who is actually not innocent and well-aware of human emotion in depth that even the guardian spirit can't help but to fall in love with her? Not to forget, a monk-in-training who vows to vanquish all spirits, good and bad, yet one day might be exorcising the friend that he has been needing the most in his entire life; forsaking his own love of his life?? Not to mention the plot twists, other side characters that have their own roles and just ghosts-how can someone not watch this masterpiece?

        </a>
        <p class="centered">
            Honestly, one of the animes that are so underrated that it's a criminal act. What do you mean we have a billionaire acting as a detective when in secret he is searching for his parents' murderer while being paired with a weary detective who was actually the best cop in the station? And, did I not mention bomb as well as betrayal with a hint of fluff?

        </a>
        <p class="centered">
            Oh, don't be foolish when the anime tells you about a story of two highschoolers that join a band only. Quite the contrary, this anime tells you a band that will be performing gut-wrenching songs relating to their own personal conflicts as well as trying to understand the depth of grief when it concerns your beloveds. Not only that, these teenagers have experienced heartaches far worse than some adults out there, let me tell you. Fun fact, the characters are inspired by a real-life band that also contributes to being their voice actors, too!
